    Info: "Brand new to the sport, Billy knows his car is the Best.\r\n\r\nSome say
      he just turned up to the track one day with no idea where he was or what he
      was doing. He says \u201CYeah, so?\u201D. All his time and money are spent
      on his Baby, all his hobbies revolve around her, so he figures, why not give
      whatever it is all this is a shot? \r\n\r\nAll the way from his small Texas
      hometown, all his friends have turned up to create Team YEAH!. They say they
      heard what he was doing and just had to support him. Because that's what friends
      do.\r\n"
