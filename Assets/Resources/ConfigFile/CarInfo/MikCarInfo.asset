    Info: "Mik has conquered every event, beaten every opponent, and is the undisputed
      Monarch of Monster Truck Mania.\r\n\r\nThose puny \u201Ccars'' can't possibly
      stand up to Mik\u2019s beautiful beast, and they are here to prove it. Sure,
      they\u2019ve never driven on \u201Ctarmac\u201D, and they might not always
      be the fastest, but have you seen these wheels? If anyone wants to get in their
      way, Mik will simply drive over them, big deal.\r\n\r\nTeam Monarch is determined
      to see Mik through. They\u2019ve been working together since the beginning,
      and have seen Mik through every major event. Together they will ensure Mik\u2019s
      reign will continue.\r\n"
