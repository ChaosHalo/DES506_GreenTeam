    Info: "Since Felicia was a baby, all she wanted to do was go fast. That only
      solidified when she started driving. \r\n\r\nShe plans to drive laps around
      her competitors, how can a monster truck, a muscle car or a sports car possibly
      hold a candle to one of the greatest marvels of physics ever seen? How could
      they possibly beat her when she practically owns speed? They can't stop her
      now, and she is having a good time. \r\n\r\nTeam Xtreme are behind her all
      the way, desperate to help her realise her dreams, and she is dreaming full
      speed ahead. \r\n"
